      <h3>Binge watch and learn more about Asian-American culture:</h3>
      <p>The Asian-American and Pacific Islander experience is unique and that experience has been brilliantly captured on television. As you watch these television programs, you should pay attention to the nuances between Asian and American cultures. Those
        nuances are the essence of the Asian-American identity. Here are some of our recommendations.</p>
      <h4>Crash Landing on You</h4>
      <p><i>Crash Landing on You</i> is a Korean telenovela about two star-crossed lovers; it depicts a romance between a South Korean heiress who “crash lands” in a demilitarized zone in North Korea and a captain from the North Korean Special Police Force. The series is accredited for its accurate portrayal of North–South Korean relations and portrayal of North Korean accents, words, and life. It has the second highest rating in South Korean cable history.
